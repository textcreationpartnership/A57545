            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The ſnare (you know) is laid on Earth, and the wiſeſt courſe would be (as a man would thinke) to have the eye thereabout where we ſuſpect the ſnare is: But (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>I will looke up;</hi> while we looke up the feet are gathered up the better. <hi>A wiſe mans eyes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>) <hi>are in his head, but a fooles eyes are in every corner of the world:</hi> Let us be as that <hi>wiſe man</hi> and have our <hi>eyes in Christ our Head,</hi> and not as the <hi>Foole,</hi> but with the <hi>Sayler,</hi> who though he be upon the Sea, yet lookes more to the Heavens then to the Sea: So do we.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he that travels in a dangerous way is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to provide himſelfe of weapons, for feare of <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;</hi> a good <hi>Staffe,</hi> or a good <hi>Sword,</hi> or both: So here in this our travell. <hi>Faith</hi> may not be wanting. <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Goliahs ſword, none like to that,</hi> ſo ſay we of this, it is a weapon <hi>offenſive, by it we overcome the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.4. <hi>and Divell,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Iames</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:37834:17"/>4.1. It is as a <hi>Piſtoll</hi> againſt a Theife, if our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſee us furniſhed with that they will not haſtily venter on us.</p>
               <p>It is alſo <hi>Defenſive,</hi> in which reſpect it is compared to a <hi>Target</hi> or <hi>Shield.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Epheſ</hi> 6.16. It defends us <hi>from the fiery darts of the evill one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a <hi>good Staffe</hi> likewiſe to reſt upon. With it (in his hand) St. <hi>Peter could walke upon the Sea; we ſtand and are ſtabliſhed by it</hi> (as ſpeaketh the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi>) Therfore (if we be wiſe) provide we our ſelves of ſuch <hi>weapons,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; he that is to travell in ſuch a way will be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after <hi>good Company:</hi> For <hi>Vae ſoli, Woe to him that is alons;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 4 9.10.</note> good ſociety takes away all tediouſneſſe from a journy: Get we into the company of the <hi>Saints,</hi> delight we in them that excell in vertue,<note place="margin">Pſ. 16.9.</note> they will helpe thee and aſſiſt thee by their <hi>Prayers,</hi> and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Their ſtrength ſhall be imployed for thy good, and thou better inabled to walk Heaven-ward: Two are better than one. (yet better one then a bad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.)</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he that travels ſome dangerous way will not be running into every <hi>by-lane;</hi> they will keep the <hi>beaten road:</hi> the Kings <hi>High way</hi> is held to be the ſafeſt way: So we, while we keepe our ſelves within the compaſſe of our calling (<hi>Generall</hi> or <hi>Particular</hi>) have promiſe of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, Pſal.</hi> 91.11. Otherwiſe we are <hi>as a Bird that wanderech from her neſt, Prov.</hi> 27.8. While it ſits brooding of her eggs, God took order that none ſhould hurt it, but being off, if any kil'd it, it was no offence: So is it with us; <hi>Balaam ſhall meet an Angell</hi> with a <hi>naked Sword,</hi> when he wanders out of <hi>his path, Numb.</hi> 22. the <hi>Prophet with a Lyon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. <hi>Shime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If the <hi>Deere,</hi> leape over the pale and will be ſtragling into the fields not keeping within the compaſſe of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37834:18"/>Parke, every dog ſhall ſet upon it, to hunt it in again. So the world, Divell, Conſcience, All, ſhall be let looſe againſt us, and a thouſand inconveniences ſhall befall us, to make our paths uncomfortable, to drive us to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and bring us back again. As <hi>God</hi> therfore <hi>hath diſtributed to every man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.17.</note> 
                  <hi>as the Lord hath called every one, ſo let him walke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, he that walketh in a perillous way will travell <hi>betweene Sunne</hi> and <hi>Sunne.</hi> Thus ſhould wee have the light of the Word for that wee doe: Before that <hi>Sunne</hi> riſeth ſtirre not out; nor be you ſeene up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way after the ſetting of it. <hi>Gods word</hi> muſt be <hi>the light unto our feet, and a lanthorne unto our pathes;</hi> Like the <hi>Cloud</hi> that went before <hi>Iſraell;</hi> ſo muſt it be to us; all our actions are to be ordered and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it.</p>
               <p>The arrow (you know) is put into the nick by the hand, and ſo ſent to the marke: Gods Word is that hand that muſt ſet us about our workes, So <hi>wee walking according unto rule Peace will bee upon us.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, he that is to travell in ſuch a way as is full of danger, will carry his <hi>Purſe</hi> or <hi>Treaſure</hi> cloſe and hide it in ſome ſecret place about him: It is not wiſdome to be boaſting of our <hi>Treaſure,</hi> as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, this is but to lay a bait for a villaine, as he did for gold thirſtie <hi>Babell.</hi> It is enough in your journey to make ſhew of a little, not all: There is <hi>Proviſion</hi> for the way; <hi>the full ſacks of Corne</hi> need not be opened, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42 25.</p>
               <p>You ſhall heare ſome young women boaſt much of their conception,<note place="margin">Iſay. 39.</note> when in the end it prooves but, a tympany to their ſhame: Better, if with old <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they would hide themſelves five monthes,<note place="margin">Luk. 1 24.</note> and be ſure they have (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) conceived before they be ſeen abroad. So in things ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Directions I commend to you, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37834:18"/>when your occaſions require your travell towards <hi>Iericho,</hi> leaſt you become a prey to thoſe, who lye (like <hi>Arabians</hi>) in the way to ſpoyle you. It is not run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Mountaines, nor to Caces; flying from all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and company, (as ſome have done) that will helpe us: For the world is every where, and theives are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where in the world. Poverty is a theife to ſteale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way wealth: Sickneſſe is a theife to ſteale away health: Death is a thiefe to ſteale away life: The World it ſelfe is a theife to ſteale away the Word. But thanke we God for that which ſo overcomes us, as that it overcomes the love of the World in us: Our Faith.</p>

               </list>
               <p>That part of the Law which was <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> belonged to <hi>Eccleſiaſticall buſineſſe</hi> (as the former did to civill) and concerned <hi>Sacrifices, Sacraments,</hi> and other rituall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; This tooke its mortall wound by the death of Chriſt, and with him died: For as it had <hi>Vigorem a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto relationem ad Chriſtum;</hi> ſo it had <hi>conſummationem in Chriſto:</hi> He gave ceremonies their beginning, and he alſo hath given them their ending.</p>
               <p>True it is this Law was not preſently throwne into the grave, but (according to the ſeemly buriall of humane bodies) they had their funeralls and were brought with ſolemnity to their Sepulchers.

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But did all Ceremonies then utterly dye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> We muſt here diſtinguiſh betwixt Ceremonies: Some Ceremonies in the old Law were mixt (being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and Ceremoniall) as for the Elder to have a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble portion; here take away the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> part as <hi>it figured Chriſt:</hi> So the <hi>Naturall</hi> part of giving the Elder a double portion may be preſerved.</p>
               <p>Thus cities of <hi>Refuge</hi> were appointed to ſave the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killer from the <hi>Revenger</hi> of blood: There was a <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie</hi> annexed to this Law, that they ſhould ſtay untill the death of the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> in the Cityes of <hi>Refuge:</hi> Take away that <hi>Ceremony</hi> and the equity of the Law may ſtand, and Cities of <hi>Refuge</hi> be kept, that thoſe who caſually kil be not ſlain.</p>
               <p>Again, ſome <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in the old Law were <hi>typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> figuring Chriſt: Theſe are dead, yea deadly in reſpect of Uſe: Of uſe (I ſay) but not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Reading, Hearing, or having inſtruction from them.</p>
               <p>Others are <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of <hi>Order:</hi> Theſe ſtill remain; for Chriſt came not to deſtroy <hi>Order:</hi> God muſt be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the body, and therfore of neceſſity there muſt be ſome outward obſervances. Provided, Firſt, for number they be few. Secondly, for ſignification plain. Thirdly, for obſervation ſimple, far from oſtentation, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>So that this makes neither for <hi>Iewiſh</hi> nor <hi>Popiſh Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:</hi> As for thoſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the Old <hi>Teſtament,</hi> they are not fit for us, the Church being now paſt her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy and come to maturity of age. Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> tells of a Youth who came to <hi>Vindecianus</hi> a Phyſitian,<note place="margin">Aug. Epiſt. <hi>19.</hi> ad Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37834:49"/>when he was a youth, which now he was of age would be deadly.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the Law were profitable for the <hi>Iewes</hi> being Children, and taken at the <hi>Commandement</hi> of God; which now to us, who are become men in Chriſt, would be mortall.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>Popiſh Ceremonies</hi> they rather become the <hi>whore of Rome</hi> then the <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt.</hi> True it is the <hi>Spouſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be without her Borders, and her Laces, yet ſhe may not flaunt it like an <hi>Harlot,</hi> but be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly attyred like a chaſt and grave Matron. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> loades her ſelfe with a heap of gaudy <hi>Cerimonies</hi> which they obtrude upon the people, as principall parts of Gods ſervice, yea worſhip them and bind mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences unto them on pain of damnation, and ſo fall under <hi>Auſtins</hi> cenſure, digging into the graves of the dead for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified and rotten reliques.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Morall part</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> is that which preſcribes the rule of a godly and upright life, being divided into two Tables, the former concerning <hi>God,</hi> the other our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> Now this Law in <hi>Conſideration of the Elect</hi> is aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the comming of Chriſt, and that both <hi>Quoad damnandi vim,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. and <hi>Quoad dominandi vim,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this; It hath the office of a <hi>Schoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Gal.</hi> 3.24. Now the office of a <hi>Schoolemaster</hi> is double, <hi>Dirigere &amp; Corrigere;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arctius.</note> So the Law directs and corrects: By feare of puniſhment it keeps under the Old-man, (the remnants wherof are yet in the beſt) and it directs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the new man in the waies of God: The Law ſends the Elect to Chriſt to be ſaved, and Chriſt ſends us back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Law to learn <hi>Obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>conſideration of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeleevers and Impenitent ones</hi> this Law is no way aboliſhed; It ſeemeth to convince them, and condemne them without all hope of <hi>mercy;</hi> as for the other two profitable Uſes it is no whit availeable unto them through their own default.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Antinomians</hi> then, who take away all uſe of the Law may ſee their folly. Chriſt met with none on the <hi>mount</hi> in his Glory, but <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias;</hi> the <hi>Law giver</hi> and the <hi>Law-reſtorer:</hi> to ſhew that he did not only come to <hi>fullfill the Law,</hi> and <hi>inſtitute</hi> the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> but even to <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell:</hi> We muſt obey what God commanded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and what we cannot performe is ſupplied to us by our <hi>Beliefe</hi> in <hi>IES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, Luke</hi> 16.16.</p>

                  <hi>Better dealing may many times be found from thoſe that are wicked and ſuperſtitious, then from ſuch who profeſſe better.</hi> You have heard what Profeſſion the Prieſt and Levite did make, and who the <hi>Samaritan</hi> was, and how ſhort he came of them, you have alſo ſeen; and yet here he ſhewes mercy when they ſhew none at all, ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.16.</p>
               <p>(That we give no offence) give me leave to explaine my ſelfe in theſe foure Concluſions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Where the true feare of God is not, no good dealing can be expected or looked for, but the contrary, <hi>Gen,</hi> 12 12.20, 21. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.9, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25, 26, 29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.18. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.5. We ſee this alſo in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Sodomites, Gen.</hi> 19.9. And in the Inhabitants of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> towards the <hi>Levite</hi> and his <hi>wife, Iud.</hi> 19.22. So that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37834:52"/>where men are without the feare of God and knowledge of his name, they are abominable in all their doings, and to every good work reprobate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, no better dealing is to be found, then where the true feare of God is. Thoſe who are truly religious, who know God and feare him, will deale well; none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.18. <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.10. Such are beſt <hi>Husbands, Gen.</hi> 21.12. Beſt <hi>Wives.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. Beſt <hi>Masters, Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.7.

               <p>Thirdly, It ſometimes ſo happens that better dealing may be found amongſt Idolaters and thoſe who are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, then amongſt ſuch as are very forward Profeſſors of Gods name and feare. Thus <hi>Ieremias</hi> found more <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> amongſt the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> then his owne people: The men of <hi>Anathoth,</hi> they ſought his <hi>life, Ier.</hi> 11.21. And put him in <hi>Priſon, Ier.</hi> 37.15. when the other knock off his <hi>Chaines,</hi> ſet him at <hi>liberty,</hi> give him <hi>victualls,</hi> and a reward as you read. <hi>Ier.</hi> 39.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 40.4, 5. So <hi>David</hi> found more favour from <hi>Achiſh</hi> King of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> then from <hi>Saul:</hi> That <hi>Philiſtin</hi> King welcomes him, ſupplies his wants, likes his converſation and preſence ſo well, as that he profeſſeth himſelfe pleaſed with him, as with an Angell of God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.2. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 29.9. <hi>Saul</hi> hunts after him, ſeeks to take his life from him, and expels him, notwithſtanding the teares, vowes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes he made to <hi>David:</hi> The promiſe of a <hi>Pagan</hi> may be ſometimes taken before the Fidelity of a profeſſed Chriſtian: Fidelity may be without the Church and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood within it. And thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> found more kindneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>Barbarians,</hi> then his own Country men: Heare what he ſaies of the entertainment he had amongſt the <hi>Iewes, Five times received I fourty ſtripes ſave one, thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I ſtoned. In perills often, in perils by robbers, in perills by mine owne Country-men, in perills amongſt falſe Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26.

And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it is ſaid to be <hi>viſible</hi> and like a houſe ſet upon a hill: <hi>Viſible</hi> I ſay <hi>Potentiâ,</hi> though not alwaies <hi>Actu,</hi> ſimply in it ſelfe <hi>viſible,</hi> though in ſome other reſpect to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37834:84"/>us <hi>inviſible:</hi> An <hi>Inne</hi> cannot be diſcerned in a great miſt or darke night; nor by a blind man: ſo in time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution (as when the Church was ſaine to flye into the wilderneſſe) or when men have through feare or anger weekned their ſight,<note place="margin">Rev. 12 14. Iſa 26.20.</note> Jt is not diſcerned by us: So <hi>Eliah</hi> could not ſee a Church, when God had 7000. there.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is like unto an <hi>Inne,</hi> it being both <hi>ſpatious</hi> and <hi>ſpecious;</hi> It is large and faire, ſo uſually <hi>Innes</hi> are,<note place="margin">Cant. 6 4, 10. 1 ſal 122 3. Cant. 4.4, 7.</note>

               <p>And as life and health is pretious in it ſelfe, ſo with much ado it is hatched up and preſerved: The life of no other creature is ſubject to ſo many dangers, outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; nor ſooner overthrowne then mans: It is like a brittle glaſſe full of pretious liquour, a ſmall knock breakes all: Or like a watch conſiſting of many wheeles and gimbals which every day muſt be wound up and kept in reparation; by meat, drinke, ſleepe, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Often it gathers duſt and growes fowle and then the hand of Phyſick is employed to cleanſe it, which if it be not carefully done, all falls to peeces preſently;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:37834:88"/>The body drops aſunder and here lies a pin and there a wheele, here one bone and there another, till the exquiſite workman who firſt made it, takes it again in hand to repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it and reunite it.</p>

In which reſpect both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Priest</hi> of old were anoynted with the ſame oyle, (as the Chalde Paraphraſe on <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.11. hath it) which was the <hi>holy oyle, Pſal.</hi> 89.27. And (in theſe later daies) at their Coronations they are not only crowned with the Diadem of the Kingdome, and girt with the Sword of Juſtice (to ſignifie their temporall Authority) but they are annoynted alſo with the oyle of <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and cloathed <hi>Stola ſacerdotali</hi> and <hi>veſte Dalmatica,</hi> as Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his <hi>Tract of the Rights of Churches</hi> hath demonſtrated, <hi>p.</hi> 117.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Tyth</hi> ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.15. which Kings u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ordinarily to receive was not <hi>Levi</hi> his <hi>tythe,</hi> but another <hi>tyth</hi> or <hi>tenth:</hi> After that <hi>Levi</hi> had tythed the people, the King ſhould <hi>tythe</hi> them over againe (Thus M. <hi>Nettles in his anſwer to the Iewiſh part of</hi> M. <hi>Seldons Hiſtory of Tythes, c.</hi> 3. §. 6. <hi>p.</hi> 127.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Though a King hath power to <hi>tythe</hi> a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and to take for the ſupplying of his neceſſities a portion of <hi>Levies tythe,</hi> yet he hath not power (ſaith D. <hi>Smith</hi> in his addition to D. <hi>Willets</hi> Hex: in <hi>Levit. cap.</hi> 25. <hi>mor.</hi> 5.) to transferre holy things to prophane uſes, he may not give them away to his ſervants, nor alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them from the Church to the Churches dammage. So alſo ſheweth <hi>Keckerman, Syſtem: Polit. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>Concering ſuch conſecrated things, the beginning wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was ſuperſtitious (as <hi>Abbi-lands</hi>) which were given for the maintenance of Idolatry, <note place="margin">D. <hi>Willet</hi> on Lev. c. 5, obſ. 5.</note> and redemption of mens ſoules, it is not to be doubted (ſay ſome) but that the civell Magiſtrate hath power to divert them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane uſes, as we read, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.27. But there is an other reaſon of <hi>tythes</hi> the proper inheritance of the Church: Theſe were from the firſt foundation of them dedicated to the Miniſtery of the Word, and originally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed by God upon his Miniſters; now neither the <hi>Pope</hi> nor King <hi>Henry the eight,</hi> can cut of an entaile (ſaith Doctor <hi>Smith on Levit.</hi> 27. <hi>mor.</hi> 4) which God hath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</p>
               <p>To conclude this branch, I could wiſh that every <hi>Lay-Impropriator</hi> would adviſedly conſider what hath bin ſaid, and know, how ever he conceives he hath nothing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:37834:99"/>for before Almighty God but <hi>Lay-vocation,</hi> yet he bath alſo (by taking of the <hi>two pence</hi>) to make anſwer for ſpirituall function; for <hi>Tythes, Tranſeunt cum onere,</hi> they carry their charge with them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, forget not that admonition which is given by <hi>Lorinus in Levit.</hi> 27.30. <hi>Caveant hi,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let theſe Lay-men take heed, who have a grant of Tythes upon this condition, that hereafter they muſt make reſtitution, leaſt they be involved in the puniſhment of eternall damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let ſuch as <hi>have taken the houſes of God in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,</hi> or poſſeſſe his portion without his aſſignement, read thoſe Plagues and Judgements threatned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt thoſe who did but ſay, <hi>Let us take,</hi> &amp;c. And what in all ages hath bin executed and inflicted on them who did take it, read D. <hi>Howſon,</hi> and D. <hi>Downham</hi> on this ſubject. And in your own obſervation you may find the truth of that which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaks, <note place="margin">See <hi>Dillingham</hi> Ser. on <hi>Pſ.</hi> 14.1 <hi>p</hi> 113.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Impropriations</hi> are at a ſtay (we truſt) they cannot take from the Church (ſaith M. <hi>Eburne</hi> in his ſecond <hi>Sermon on Math.</hi> 12 21. <hi>pag.</hi> 29.) more then already they have (albeit many a greedy and ſacrilegious minded perſon, el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſires or attempts it) but theſe ſort of perſons do daily more and more encroach upon the Church to the ſpoyle and bane of it, the hinderance of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of learning.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That we know <hi>his Perſon:</hi> Say the man be ſuch a one as a man may ſafely undertake for, yet it followes not that we ſhould undertake for him, not knowing who he is: This is too much raſhneſſe and may bring us woe.</p>

               <p n="3">3. We ſhould not be a ſtranger <hi>to the cauſe:</hi> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be lawfull would be inquired into: He that undertaketh for a bad matter may be ſuſpected to be little better than an acceſſary. We read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.17, 18

True it is, the <hi>Surety</hi> is to make account to pay the debt (or ſee it paid) unto the <hi>Creditour,</hi> be he what he will be, yet it is more comfortable to deale with a religious then an irreligious perſon, what ere ſhould happen, <hi>Mat,</hi> 18 Say (through default in the Principall) thou that art the <hi>Surety</hi> comes to be arreſted; whilſt thou art in the ſnare of a cruell <hi>Creditor,</hi> thy Profeſſion comes to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted likewiſe.

               <p>Confider well the <hi>Sum:</hi> Tell it over (as it were) in ready mony, look well upon it, and think if thou ſhouldeſt part with ſo much, whither it would not break thy back, undo thy Family, cauſe thee and thine all thy life long after to live moſt uncomfortably. <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.13.</note> It is a wiſe ſaying of the Son of <hi>Syrach.

               <p n="1">1. Bare <hi>Profeſſion</hi> (though a thing excellent yet) it is no characteriſticall difference to diſcriminate a ſound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian from a reprobate; we do not judge of the health of the body ſo much by talke as by the pulſe, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of a poſſibility <hi>to have all knowledge yet bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the end of our <hi>Profeſſion</hi> is not idle ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but practiſe: God gave us his precepts not to know
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:37834:122"/>but do; wherfore ſerves the Sun, but that man may go forth unto his labour? So for the ſame end the light of Knowledge, God lends to us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2 15. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. It muſt be <hi>knowledge after Godlineſſe,</hi> it muſt help forward that work; while Knowledge ſwimmeth only in the brain, it hath not attained his end; the ſcope of Chriſtianity being not to know, but the ſcope of Knowledge is to be a good Chriſtian. This graceth <hi>Profeſſion;</hi> as the managing of a trade honours it above the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of it. You may remember that paſſage, <hi>Chriſt knew no ſinne,</hi> why ſo? Surely becauſe <hi>he did no ſinne:</hi> So much as we do, ſo much we know and no more: In <hi>Muſick</hi> we have learned that Leſſon when we have practiſed: So is it in <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> therfore ſee you <hi>Goe</hi> and <hi>Doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſweet of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is in <hi>Practice.</hi> What is it that makes the ſtudy of Law ſweet to ſo many (as is well obſerved by one) but the practice of it? Is there not difference betwixt hearing of the ſweetneſſe of Sugar and hony, and the taſt of the ſweetneſſe? So it is and ſuch it is, betwixt the <hi>diſcourſe</hi> of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> and the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe</hi> therof. Beſides the Retribution is for <hi>doing, Math.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Revel,</hi> 1.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.21. and that is the ſweet indeed, wherfore <hi>Goe and Doe.</hi>

Thus <hi>Theodoſius</hi> excuſed a fowle fact, becauſe <hi>David</hi> had done the like, to whom S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> makes this anſwer, <hi>qui ſequutus es errantem, ſequere paenitentem:</hi> But this we cannot hit on.

               <p>Other of their <hi>Actions</hi> were <hi>Ordinary:</hi> and thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a threefold diſtinction: ſome were <hi>good,</hi> others <hi>bad,</hi> others of an <hi>indifferent nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for thoſe which are noted as ſinfull, wherein they bewray humane infirmity, they are as the darke part of the cloud which waited on the Campe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> which while the <hi>Egyptians</hi> followed, they were deceived, and in the end drowned. Theſe are ſpectacles of humane frailty, not examples for like practiſe.</p>
               <p>Their good <hi>Actions</hi> were their practiſes, according with the Law of God: as their <hi>meekeneſſe, obedience, patience,</hi> &amp;c. which is like the firſt part of the cloud that was towards the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves, to guide them: herein we muſt follow and imitate them.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Indifferent Actions</hi> are thoſe, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (conſidered without circumſtances) were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>commanded</hi> nor <hi>forbidden:</hi> In <hi>Actions</hi> of this nature, we may, or may not follow them: For this is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable rule; <hi>an example doth no farther bind, then it is backt with a precept.</hi> In it ſelfe it hath but the power of <hi>illuſtration</hi> of what is in the precept, and it doth conteine in it the force of the rule. So that an example of ſome good man (in ſuch <hi>Actions</hi> as are not contradictory to precepts,) onely warrant the

               <p>This doth not onely make Religion to be well ſpoken of, but it profits many, even a world of people, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.

It will not onely like <hi>Aarons</hi> oyntment, run downe to the skirts of our owne gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but it will run like <hi>Nilus</hi> over all the Country. Yea the vertue of good <hi>Examples,</hi> ſhall laſt when we are dead and rotten, and doe good for a long time after (in ſome caſes) to the worlds end, keeping the ſent ſo long as no other perfume can: (as you ſee here this <hi>example</hi> of the <hi>Samaritane</hi> did.) It ſhall be upon record while the world ſtands. You may remember what <hi>Ioab</hi> ſaid of <hi>Rabba, It will be called after my name.</hi> So it is true of many exemplary ſins, as <hi>Ieroboams, Onans, Balaams, Corahs, Sodoms,</hi> &amp;c. They are called by the Founders owne names; and though few men will confeſſe their
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:37834:125"/>ſins, yet many mens ſins will confeſſe their maſter. To be a preſident of vice, is like the ſetting ones houſe on fire, which burnes many of the neighbours, and ſo he that doth it is to anſwer for all their ruines: Such a bitter root muſt anſwer for it ſelfe, and for all the corrupt branches. On the other ſide, in <hi>virtuous Actions,</hi> (both wayes) a man lives when he is dead, and is working to the worlds end: ſo that thoſe deeds we have done while wee were living on the earth, wee ſhall not onely receive for, but thoſe alſo done through our example in future ages. Great need then have wee to be good preſidents, ſeeing it is a thing of ſo great conſequence.</p>
